# qchack-microsoft-submission
This repository was created in order to submit QCHack Microsoft challenge.
You can view problems [here](https://github.com/quantumcoalition/qchack-microsoft-challenge).

All code was created by Takuki Kurokawa(tabr) alone.

I'm not sure I could make my submission. Just in case, I created [this](https://github.com/takukikurokawa/qchack-microsoft-submission) repository which I forked from Microsoft.

If you have some problems, feel free to contact me.
